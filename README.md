<b>Purpose: </b>
 Build an interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity of bacteria found in the human navel. 

<b>Results:</b>
   The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in greater than 70% of people, while the remaining bacteria were rarely found.

<b> Charts created:</b>
 The following chart types were created in order to best present the data in an understandable way.<br><br>

#### A bar chart was chosen as a way to provide an overall picture that is quickly processed visually.<BR>

#### I decided that a bubble chart would be a simple and visually compelling way to illustrate the population differences between the sample bacteria.<BR>

#### Shower & bathing has an affect on bacteria population and a gague chart is perfect for illustrating the person's wash frequency and amount of bacteria present. <BR>
